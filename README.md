## Working Papers

- Evidence on Inflation Expectations Formation Using Large Language Models [(Draft)](https://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=4825076)

This paper integrates generative AI with survey experiments to explore inflation expectations in Large Language Models. It shows that knowledge domain significantly affects expectations; LLMs accessing relevant economic documents exhibit lower variance. LLMs generally predict higher inflation than actual rates, reflecting human-like behavior. Information treatments, particularly involving forward guidance, influence LLMs' inflation expectations almost perfectly. Additionally, the introduction of a persona in the prompts results in partisan expectations, reflecting patterns observed in human surveys. The paper also examines the influence of model selection, highlighting how it significantly shapes the outcomes.
