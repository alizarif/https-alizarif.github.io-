I am a 4th Year PhD student in Economics at Indiana University. My research interests include Experimental Economics, Behavioral Macroeconomics, Textual Analysis, and the Economics of Large Language Models.

## Working Papers

- Evidence on Inflation Expectations Formation Using Large Language Models [(Draft)](https://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=4825076)

This paper integrates generative AI with survey experiments to explore inflation expectations in Large Language Models. It demonstrates that knowledge domains significantly influence expectations, with LLMs accessing relevant economic documents showing lower variance. LLMs generally predict higher inflation than actual rates, closely mirroring the Survey of Consumer Expectations. Information treatments, especially forward guidance, almost perfectly shape LLMs' inflation expectations. Introducing a persona in the prompt results in partisan expectations, reflecting patterns observed in human surveys. The study also examines model selection and the chain of thought process of a specific model, highlighting how they significantly shape responses.

## Works in Progress

- The AI Persuasion Project [(Website)](https://sites.google.com/view/ai-persuasion/team?authuser=0)

A cross-disciplinary big-team science effort to study LLM capability evaluation in the context of persuasion

- Assessing Risk and Time Preferences in AI Agents

## Publications

- Economics of ChatGPT: A Labor Market View on the Occupational Impact of Artificial Intelligence [(Link)](https://www.emerald.com/insight/content/doi/10.1108/JEBDE-10-2023-0021/full/html)

This study examines how ChatGPT affects the labor market. I first thoroughly analyzed the prior research that has been done on the subject in order to start understanding how ChatGPT and other AI-related services are influencing the labor market. Using the supply and demand model, I then assess ChatGPT's impact. This paper examines this innovation's short- and long-term effects on the labor market, concentrating on its challenges and opportunities. Furthermore, I employ a text-mining approach to extract various tasks from the International Standard Occupation Classification to present a comprehensive list of occupations most sensitive to ChatGPT.

## Some Resources

- This is a simple code for integrating an AI chatbot powered by the OpenAI Assistants API into Qualtrics surveys. The detailed explanation can be read in the tutorial:
